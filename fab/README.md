I used JLC to assemble these circuit boards, but they have made mistakes on every single batch.

On the final batch that I will ever make with them, 240 Model S v2.3's, they ruined 142 of them.

JLC made several incorrect excuses as to why it was my fault, and refused to refund me. After two months of debating and gathering evidence, I got most of the money back through a PayPal dispute.

I will have the gerber/BOM/CPL files here for informational purposes only, but I do not advise using JLC.
